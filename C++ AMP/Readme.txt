the rest of C++ AMP is available through the <amp.h> header file in the concurrency namespace. The key C++ AMP classes are: array (container for data on an accelerator), array_view (wrapper for data), index (N-dimensional point), extent (N-dimensional size), accelerator (computational resource, such as a GPU, on which to allocate memory and execute), and accelerator_view (view of an accelerator). There is also a global function, parallel_for_each, which you use to write a C++ AMP parallel loop.
