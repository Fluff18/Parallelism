Compiling a Cilk program is similar to compiling an ordinary C or C++ program. To compile a Cilk program using Tapir/LLVM, add the -fcilkplus flag to the clang or clang++ command you would use to compile and link an ordinary serial program. When run, the resulting executable will use the Cilk runtime system to execute in parallel on whatever parallel processors are available on the machine.
